### Choose Players
Each empty square represents a potential player. Click on a square to select that player. This also assigns a number to that player, which represents the order. You can deselect a player by clicking on the square again. Click on the white square with the circle to confirm your selection.

Room25 needs at least 4 playable characters, which is why all potential players will be treated as selected if less than 4 players have been selected.
